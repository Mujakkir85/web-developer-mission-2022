                <h1>Who is <br>Web developer</h1>
                <p>A web developer’s job is to create websites. While their primary role is to ensure the website is
                    visually appealing and easy to navigate, many web developers are also responsible for the website’s
                    performance and capacity.Web developers usually fall under one of three categories: back-end
                    developers, front-end developers, and full-stack developers. Some web developers also work as
                    webmasters. </p>

                <h1>How to become<br>a web developer</h1>
                <p>A formal education isn’t always necessary to become an entry-level web developer. Some web developers
                    have an associate's or bachelor’s degree in website design or computer science, but others teach
                    themselves how to code and design websites. While earning a degree can make you a more competitive
                    candidate, a strong portfolio can go a long way toward validating your skills to potential
                    employers.</p>
